<p>The purpose of this organization is to incentivize the world around us to do more good in the communities that they live in. We also strive to provide support, resources, and awareness of community service organizations nationwide. This page will be provinding calendars to community service events as well as direct links to websites for different initiatives to contribute to. The ultimate goal is to create a search engine for organizations nationwide to connect them with people that have a desire to create a better world for themselves and others.</p>
